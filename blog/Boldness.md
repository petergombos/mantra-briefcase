Boldness as a value in values-driven organisation culture

In a values-driven organisation culture, boldness is a key value. This means having the courage to stand up for what you believe in, even when it’s difficult or unpopular. It means being willing to take risks, and to speak up and be heard.

Being bold doesn’t mean being reckless or careless. It means having the courage to stand up for your beliefs, and to take calculated risks. It means being willing to speak up, even when it’s difficult or unpopular.

Boldness is a key value in values-driven organisation cultures because it allows organisations to challenge the status quo, and to innovate and create change. Without boldness, organisations can become stagnant, and their values can become meaningless.
