Charity is one of the most important values in a values-driven organisation. It is the value that drives us to help others, to put their needs above our own, and to work for the greater good.

At its heart, charity is about caring for others. It is about giving of ourselves – our time, our energy, our resources – to help those who are less fortunate than us. It is about working to make the world a better place, one small act of kindness at a time.

Charity is a value that is often at the core of values-driven organisations. This is because values-driven organisations are typically mission-driven organisations. That is, they are driven by a desire to make a difference in the world, to create positive change.

And what better way to create positive change than by helping those in need?

Of course, charity is not just about giving money to good causes. It is also about giving of our time and energy. It is about volunteering, mentoring, and supporting others. It is about being there for those who need us.

At its best, charity is a selfless act. It is about putting others first, and making a difference in their lives. It is a value that can change the world, one act of kindness at a time.
