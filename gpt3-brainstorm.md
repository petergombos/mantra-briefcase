A values-driven company is one that is guided by a set of core values that inform everything they do. This can include everything from the way they treat their employees and customers, to the products and services they offer.

There are many benefits to running a values-driven company. Perhaps the most obvious is that it can help to create a strong culture and identity for the business. When everyone is working towards the same goals and values, it can help to create a sense of unity and purpose.

It can also help to attract and retain the best talent. People want to work for companies that align with their own values, so a values-driven business is likely to be more attractive to job seekers.

Finally, operating in a values-driven way can also be good for business. Customers are increasingly interested in supporting businesses that share their values, so a values-driven company is likely to be more successful in the long-term.

How to define your company's values?

There is no right or wrong answer to this question, as each company will have different values that are important to them. However, some tips on how to define your company's values may include holding brainstorming sessions with employees to get ideas, surveying customers to see what they believe is important to the company, and evaluating the company's core mission and goals to see what values align with these. Once you have a list of potential values, you can narrow it down by discussing with employees and leaders which values are most important to the company and would be most beneficial to focus on.

Your company values are like a mantra because they should be something you live by. They should guide your actions and decisions, and be a reminder of what your company stands for.
