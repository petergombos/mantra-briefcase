# Accountability

Acknowledging and owning up to the responsibility you have to your employees, customers, community, industry, and shareholders.

Examples of accountability in action include making things right when you’re responsible for a mistake, admitting when you are wrong, and seeing tasks and projects through until they are done – and done well.

# Belonging

Ensuring everyone involved in your company in any capacity feels like they have a place – from a face to be seen, to a voice to be heard. Companies that
value belonging seek out multiple opinions from their stakeholders and strive to ensure all involved in the company truly feel valued.

Examples of belonging in a company include investing in building diverse teams, using inclusive language and imagery in content, and actively seek- ing out voices from majority and minority communities.

# Boldness

Taking notable, effective, and occasionally uncommon actions to ensure your company, product, or service has a direct impact. Being bold means thinking outside the box and balancing bravery with a results-driven mentality.

Examples of organizations being bold could include teams focusing specifically on high-impact work or encouraging employees to speak out against groupthink during a team project.

# Care

Care can refer to dedication to the well-being of a person or group of people, or to a commitment to being attentive, calculated, and considerate in the way work is done.

Examples of care in an organization include offering employee wellness & mental health benefits, as well as organizational donations to or fundraisers for charities. In its other sense, it could also mean taking your time with a project, rather than rushing something to the finish line unnecessarily.

# Charity

The act of giving. While this value certainly involves putting your money where your mouth is, an organization that lists charity as a company value will do more than just sign checks
– it will instill a charitable mindset in all of its employees and company representatives through actions and efforts.

Examples of charity in an organization can include annual donations to important causes, pledging a portion of sales or proceeds to a non-profit, or organizing volunteer programs for employees and customers – and actively encouraging them to take part.

# Collaboration

Working together towards a common goal. Collaboration is valued by your employees who want to feel like their input matters, your partners who want to be by your side for a phenomenal customer experience, and your customers who want to feel like they’re more to you than just another client.

Examples of collaboration include investing in interactive employee programs, software, and workspaces, hiring for more customer-facing roles, growing a list of integration partners, and actively sourcing feedback from your customers.

# Commitment

Dedication to your company’s mission, vision, and values. A company that is committed is unwavering in its support for those who support its existence – namely, customers and em- ployees.

Examples of commitment in the workplace include building clear career paths so your em- ployees feel like they have the ability to grow, or investing in a thriving customer support and success organization to help customers maximize their use of your product.

# Communication

Making yourself heard, and making sure you hear others. Companies that value communication are impeccable messengers and content creators. They place importance on forming and maintaining relationships with stakeholders through conversation and involvement.

Examples of commitment in action include setting up clear paths for your clients to reach your company for requesting support or leaving feedback, sourcing employee opinions of your work environment with an employee NPS survey, and keeping your clients frequently updated with product and service updates.

# Community

An emphasis on the people in your shared physical space or mental space. A company that values community can be actively involved in the city, state, or neighborhood in which they are located, or they can stand for their community of users (i.e. “the gaming community” for a company that makes video games).

Examples of embodying the value of community include hosting events for your customer or user base, maintaining a strong presence in your location’s community through sponsorships or attendance at local events, or making an active effort to localize your presence based on the location in which you do business (i.e. designing each store with local decor).

# Courage

The willingness and ability to overcome fear in order to do something meaningful. In the workplace, courage can be evidenced by anyone, ranging from the CEO to an individual contributor. However, a culture of courage is what it takes to fully embody this ideal.

Examples of courage in the workplace include speaking up during a meeting to share an unpopular but valid opinion, taking action that is morally or ethically good for the company but may not be the best immediate financial decision, and encouraging employees to speak out to HR if they see inappropriate behavior that needs to be addressed.

# Creativity

Creativity is all about thinking outside the box. It’s traditionally (and understandably) associated with designers and artists, but creativity can be possessed by engineers, mathematicians, and salespeople as well. It’s simply going about a situation in a new, inventive way.

Companies can show they value creativity by investing in a dedicated creative team of artists, designers, and videographers, as well as fostering an environment of constant improvement in your office – experimenting with new colors, flavors, or problem-solving approaches.

# Customer-Obsession

Customer obsession is a complete and total dedication to your customers, users, and members. Companies with a customer-first mentality are proactive and consistent in their communication with customers, and dedicate more resources than expected to developing and improving products and services that produce an incredible ROI and experience for customers.

Companies show customer obsession by investing heavily into R&D, building a frontline
of customer support reps and account managers, frequently sending out surveys and NPS questionnaires, and allowing for and responding to every customer complaint or comment.

# Delight

Similar to customer obsession, delight can be defined as acting on that customer obsession to impress your customers and make them smile. Delight could also be a general outlook companies have towards everybody with whom they interact – from clients, to partners, to employees.

Companies can showcase delight by putting the “wow” factor above all else. Examples include going above and beyond to make amends when a company messes up, sending gifts to customers, and giving employees the day off before a holiday weekend.

# Discipline

Companies that value discipline display tact, patience, and commitment. They stay focused on their end goals and don’t let anything sidetrack them from hitting their targets. They display accountability and resilience, even when it’s not the popular choice at the time.

Companies that embody discipline
avoid getting caught up in fleeting industry trends and making exceptions to a rule, no matter who violates it.

# Diversity

Making a company-wide commitment to build a diverse and inclusive organization that’s reflective of your customer base. You’ve likely heard that diverse teams are proven to perform better than teams that lack diversity. But creating a company culture where everyone’s unique ideas, backgrounds, and perspectives are valued is also the right thing to do for your employees, customers, and candidates.

Making diversity a core value at your company may look like evolving your recruiting processes to be more inclusive, introducing employee resource groups, and investing in career growth opportunities for underrepresented minorities. Once you’ve made changes internally, sharing your value of diversity externally can help signal to customers and candidates that they’re welcome at your organization.

# Education

The quest of knowledge and understanding. This value is not exclusively reserved for institutions of higher learning – even though that’s where it is most commonly associated. Education can be the value of a company that places an emphasis on employee education, or even by a publication that wants to educate its readers on meaningful current events.

Companies can showcase a value of education by providing employee education stipends to invest in degrees or further education. It can also be seen by companies that donate a portion of their profits to educational institutions, scholarship funds, or related charities.

# Employee Development

Investing in fostering your employee’s professional and personal growth. Companies that value employee development recognize that a company performs better when its employees feel happy, appreciated, and fulfilled – not overworked and undervalued. The resulting positivity often spills over into stronger outcomes – and can have an impact on customer retention as well.

If a company values employee development, it may invest in employee health and wellness benefits around health, education, work-life balance, and other perks that make employees feel like they have room to grow and succeed in the organization.

# Ethics

Having strong principles to guide a business’ decisions and actions. If a company values ethics, it will never betray the idea of doing what is right. This includes making respectful, moral decisions pertaining to employee, customer, shareholder, and supplier relations.
Companies that put ethics as a core value might prove it by promoting fair wages and sustainability, putting guardrails into place to ensure all laws are followed, and making decisions that will benefit a company’s stakeholders in the long run over its leadership team in the short term.

# Excellence

Holding oneself to extraordinarily high standards. Companies that strive for excellence are constantly raising the bar and aiming to outdo the competition at every turn. This focus on operating at the highest industry standard holds every individual accountable for doing their best work.

If a company values excellence, it likely has instilled rigorous QA and R&D protocols, sourcing high-quality raw materials, and/or investing in a dedicated customer success team to ensure all customers use its products/services to the fullest extent.

# Factualness

Displaying and promoting accuracy, truthfulness, and validity in an unbiased way. Factualness might be possessed by academic and research institutes, news outlets, legal firms, or even publicly-funded justice departments.

Organizations might showcase factualness by citing their sources and explaining the process from which they have reached their conclusions – particularly when it comes to polls, research papers, publications, and legal rulings.

# Fast-Learning

The prioritization of discovering knowledge and developing skills. Companies might cite fast-learning as a value if they expect employees to fail fast and be quick to pick up a new ability to keep the business running smoothly.

Fast-learning can be embodied by employees who set deadlines for acquiring a new skill, are expected to know when to ask questions, and are expected to be so customer-obsessed that they waste no time solving for them.

# Focus

Showing unwavering dedication to the initiatives and projects that matter the most. Companies that value focus are results- driven and dedicated to their end goal.

Companies that have the word “focus” in their values typically have another word associated with it, like “customer,” “results,” or “employees,” or even ideals like “focus on doing what’s right.” Therefore, consider pairing this value with another one.

# Fun

Enjoyment while developing or using what ends up on your product line. Fun can be a value of a hyper-focused team at a startup that wants to change the world and have a good time doing it, a company that sells toys and games, and anything in between. A term like this will certainly attract applicants who want a healthy work-life balance and value a welcoming workplace culture.

Companies that choose fun as a value might show it by providing creative ways for employees to brainstorm, such as whiteboards and other art supplies, and encourage and support employee outings after work.

# Global

Taking a secular approach to customer, product, and employee development. Companies that value being global understand that their actions as an organization have an impact beyond the walls of their offices or the areas they do business. They recognize and embrace the impact of globalization and factor it into their business models.

Companies with a global focus have aggressive expansion goals in multiple countries in regions and may have concrete plans to open international offices, acquire international customers, and partner with international organizations to make a global impact. Being global could also come across as awareness of your position and could tie into lowering your negative impact on the planet with sustainability initiatives.

# Growth

A company that includes growth as a value is unwavering in bettering itself and its stakeholders by setting aggressive but achievable growth goals. An organization that values growth looks back on the previous day as the baseline from which to improve.

Growth is seen in companies in many forms – growth in leads, employees, customers, office locations, products, product lines – to name a few. A company that takes its growth seriously will make these goals specific, deadline-driven, and adjustable in the face of goal-altering information.

# Hard Work

The simplest, clearest way to convey that you’re willing to put the work and effort into your tasks. A company that lists hard work as one of its values likely wants to prove itself as a no-nonsense, straightforward, and reliable business.

Hard work is evidenced by two facets: process and results. Companies will put the effort into their work, and they will know they’ve lived up to their value of hard work with satisfied customers. The results are seen with good reviews and customer retention.

# Health

Being of sound mind and body. Many will associate health with companies that make exercise equipment and natural foods, and this makes sense – leaders of companies that
value health try to share that passion with their products. However, a company that doesn’t sell these products can still list health as a value.

For example, companies can value employee health and prove it by offering a benefits package that includes insurance, a gym membership stipend, and options for mental health counseling, alongside placing a strong emphasis on work-life balance in the workplace, allotting for mental health days, and even providing healthy snacks in the break room.

# Honesty

Sincere, truthful, and right. Companies that value honesty never try to skirt the truth, whether it be in owning a past mistake or in recognizing and embracing an unavoidable shift in the industry.

Companies can showcase honesty by quickly admitting and explaining any mishaps to their stakeholders. Honesty with employees is also important, and companies can express it by going so far as adopting an open-book management policy.

# Hospitality

Friendliness, generosity, and welcoming are all synonyms to hospitality. Hospitality is often employed by business in the food, tourism, and hotel industry, which is appropriate – the more welcome they make customers feel in these situations, the more successful the business is.

Hospitality is embodied by organizations that always put the customer first. This could be seen by ensuring someone from your staff welcomes guests when they come into your business, adhering to uncommon but completely doable requests, and making it clear you will go above and beyond to preserve a guest’s level of comfort.

# Human

People-obsessed, natural, and uncomplicated. Companies that describe themselves and their approach to business as human might put a personal approach to their customer and employee interactions and aim to be straightforward in their communication. It’s not the eradication of process and procedure, but instead the choice to rely on it only when simplicity and a conversation aren’t sufficient.

A company could show its humanity by limiting the steps of (or eliminating) a phone tree to make it easier to speak to a support or sales rep, or eliminating employee red tape when one of your workers needs to speak to a leader in the company.

# Idealism

Aspirationalism, or the belief that there’s always room for something greater. Idealism is particularly popular in technology companies, especially SaaS. The idea that customers are investing in a company that is always working to one-up itself is reassuring, and holding employees to the idea that there is always room for personal and professional growth at- tracts talented candidates.

Companies might showcase idealism by developing and sharing their product roadmap years out at a time, holding frequent product announcements (like Apple), and having clear growth paths for employees to show them how they could advance in their careers if they stay with the company.

# Impact

Having influence or an effect on your industry, customer base, and/or employees. Companies that want to make an impact know the ramifications of their work, and take a methodical but unwavering approach towards making a difference with positive results.

Companies that value impact will go out of their way to connect the work they are doing to their effects on customers, which can be done by creating and sharing case studies, or sending customer quotes and reviews to the team. Companies might also share frequent performance updates with the team as a whole so that employees can trace their work to its impact on the customer and on the business’ bottom line.

# Improvement

Always trying to better oneself. Companies that place an emphasis on improvement recognize there’s nowhere to go but up – for the sake of employees, customers, and shareholders.

To show that improvement is one of your values as a company, you might hold employee performance reviews more than once a year, actively seek out customer feedback on how to make your products and/or services better, and invest in research and development to spearhead change in your organization and industry.

# Innovation

Focused on developing a new way to approach a problem. Companies that are innovative display creative thinking and optimism, and are constantly developing new technologies, solutions, and workarounds that can change the world for a subset of people – or even the world as a whole. Innovation is often associated with tech companies in Silicon Valley, but the term can apply to any organization that’s described above.

If innovation is one of a company’s core values, that company might obsessively interact with and observe those in its target market, commit to conducting multiple trials before de- ciding on a solution, and encourage employees to brainstorm regularly by providing them with whiteboards and collaboration space.

# Integrity

Honest, ethical, and accurate are terms to describe companies that value integrity. These companies will never do wrong by their customers and want to have the term trust associated with their organizations.

A company that values integrity can embody it by conducting business ethically and legally, providing documentation to customers and explaining how conclusions were reached, and openly admitting any mistakes or wrongdoing by the company.

# Leadership

Guiding your organization and its customers, employees, and sector. The product of leadership is relationship, and leadership can be seen in so many ways – from being a market leader with an unmatched product, or being committed to leading employees.

Leadership is exemplified by companies when they take actions like releasing products or services that put them at the top of their industry as market leaders, thus initiating industry-wide change. On a smaller scale, leadership from an employee standpoint could include pairing up new hires with mentors to get those new hires up to speed faster.

# Mindfulness

Being self-aware and considerate as an organization. An entity that is mindful shows an understanding of how its actions impact others, whether those people are involved in the organization or not.

For example, a company in the biotech or chemistry fields might choose mindfulness as a value if it is taking precautions to ensure its work does not negatively impact the people directly involved in development, or the environment as a whole. Alternatively, if the work being done at the organization is particularly laborious or taxing, a mindful company would take that into account and provide resources for employees so they feel supported and well-rested.

# Openness

A willingness to embrace new information or ideas and change as a result of their validity and relevance. This value does not clash with other values – such as committed or disciplined – if the openness does not detract from your organization’s mission and purpose.

Companies that are open may show a positive reception to an employee’s or a customer’s feedback and make a change to the organization as a result. Additionally, openness can be seen in a company that is forward-thinking and actively looking for new solutions to long-lasting problems.

# Passion

Obsession with what you do – sometimes to a fault. Companies throw the word “passion” around a lot these days, to the point where some would argue it has lost its meaning. However, that does not mean that truly passionate organizations cannot claim it as one of their values.

Passion simply means living up to what you claim to be all about as a company. If you’re passionate about healthy eating, helping companies grow, or data science, instill that passion into every decision or product your company makes.

# Professionalism

Handling workplace situations with respect, class, and high standards. Valuing professionalism means shirking away from a casual approach to doing business and showing your stakeholders that customer satisfaction is of the utmost importance.

Professionalism can be seen by companies insisting on meeting in-person or over video rather than over the phone with clients and employees, focusing more on substance than style in content and documentation creation, and reminding employees that they represent your company both inside and outside your office’s walls.

# Quality

Meeting exceptionally high standards. Quality is a value of businesses that pride themselves on their outputs – particularly if they provide raw materials that would go into another business’ supply chain.

Examples of a business displaying the value of quality includes setting up multiple quality checks in the production process, reviews and displaying scores from Google My Business or the BBB, and offering to remake or redo a product or service that is insufficient in the eyes of the customer.

# Respect

Admiration, regard, and consideration for someone or something. In a business, it’s typically your customers, employees, and/or community.

Respect can be found in countless different places in an organization – how good an employee’s benefits are show how much a company respects the people who make the company work. Another example is pricing: a fair price point that respects the work put into product development, in addition to the honest benefits that the customer will see, shows respect for your buyers.

# Responsibility

The recognition and taking of ownership when the situation calls for it. Organizations have a responsibility to those that keep their doors open by following through with any promises made.

In a company, responsibility can look like a very quid-pro-quo relationship. This can appear as companies just providing the services and products to the customers that paid for them. However, responsibility can also mean so much more. For example, a company with proprietary information might believe it has a responsibility to share the benefits of that knowledge with the world to make it a better place.

# Results-Oriented

Focused on achieving the agreed-upon end goal in the right way and in the right time. An organization that is results- oriented lives up to its promises on quality, deadlines, and deliverables for its customers – and expects its employees to be motivated by the same factors.

A results-oriented business might prove it by presenting detailed strategies to prospects before closing a deal and setting up frequent check-ins to ensure the process and timeline are meeting up with expectations. These companies will stop at nothing to ensure the agreed- upon target is hit.

# Service

Emphasizing the desire to help and support those around you, and to put them first always. Service can be applied in several ways as a company value, applying to customer service and support, to a server in a restaurant, or to community service. However, it largely ties back to putting others – particularly those who have a relationship with your company – above yourself.

Companies living up to the value of service might host a “day of service” for employees to spend a day engaging in community volunteer work, hire and train a large customer ser- vice team to handle customer inquiries hastily, or place an emphasis on hiring employees with a proven customer-first mindset.

# Simplicity

Taking an approach that is not complex or convoluted. In a company that values
simplicity, tasks are completed in the most straightforward way possible. Valuing simplicity doesn’t mean you’re not creative – it means that you value your employees’ and customers’ time and don’t want to get bogged down by too many technicalities.

Simplicity in a company could appear in many ways, such as having a short meetings policy for employees, or listing prices transparently on your website so your prospects know whether or not your business is a good fit.

# Speed

Prioritizing careful hastiness when completing tasks and projects. Your stakeholders are short on time, so it’s your job to get them what they need without meandering. Otherwise, it’s possible these people will find another company to associate with.

A company that values speed will set aggressive deadlines and honor them at all costs. This could pertain to customer support interactions, an employee raise schedule, and onboarding new hires, for example.

# Sustainability

Ensuring your work (or the results of it) do not overtly deplete the earth’s resources or cause damage to the environment. Companies that value sustainability – particularly clothing, food, and nature companies – don’t want to take too much away from the environment that keeps them in business.

Sustainability can be seen by companies pledging to lower their carbon footprint, using naturally-sourced or grown materials, moving away from fossil fuels, or even simply having recycling posts around the office.

# Transparency

Transparent companies pride themselves on having nothing to hide. Companies with similar values of integrity, openness, and honesty might want to include transparency in their values as well. It paints your organization as wholesome, authentic, and unwilling to hide the truth.

Companies might show transparency by being radically candid with employees about the company’s performance and what changes need to happen – if any – to keep the company successful. As for customer relations, transparency might be seen when companies send detailed bills to customers, rather than a bottom-line number that is due, so customers know where their money is going.

# Trust

A two-way street of believing in your stakeholders and ensuring they can believe in you. While some companies are only in business for the bottom line, companies that value trust want their customers to believe they have the customers’ best interests in mind – and the same goes for employees.

A company that values trust ensures its employees always follow through on the commitments they have made to customers and employees – and owns up to it after falling short. After all, a company that shows its untrustworthiness once often has a hard time winning that trust back.
